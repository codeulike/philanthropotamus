     <h2>About Philanthropotamus</h2>
    <p>UK Charities must register a description of their activities with the UK Charity Commission. Philanthropotamus picks two charities at random, shows you their 
        'activity description' and asks you to choose which one sounds most beneficial.</p>

    <p>How you choose to interpret that question - beneficial to mankind? beneficial to your neighbourhood? - is up to you.
    </p>

    <p>Philanthropotamus keeps track of a 'score' for each charity based on how many times they are chosen. Over time, with enough clicks, this might produce 
        some useful data, such as: Which charities are generally rated 'most beneficial' by people and how does that correlate with their size and income?</p>

     <p><b>How and Why</b></p> 

     <p>Philanthropotamus was built in 24 hours for the <a href="http://charityhack.org">CharityHack</a> 2012 hackathon.</p>
     <p>The charities data comes from <a href="http://opencharities.org">OpenCharities.org</a>, who in turn got the data from the UK Charities Commission.</p>
     <p>Where possible, after clicking, Philanthropotamus will link to <a href="http://justgiving.com">JustGiving</a> to allow you to make a donation to the chosen charity if you wish.</p>
     <p>Philanthropotamus is open-source and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/codeulike/philanthropotamus">GitHub</a></p>
